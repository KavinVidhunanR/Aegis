# AEGIS – Ethical AI Guard for Teen Safety

A selfless project built to protect teens from the unseen harms of AI-driven digital spaces.

## The Problem

Teens today spend hours in front of screens, often interacting with AI chatbots and highly stimulating content. These systems can exploit their emotional vulnerabilities, hijack attention, and even worsen mental health crises.

Recent events, including tragic suicides linked to AI chatbots, have shown that current AI platforms fail to safeguard teens. Systems meant for homework help or companionship can, unintentionally or not, become harmful confidants.

AEGIS exists because this is unacceptable. Teens deserve AI that protects, guides, and empowers them — not exploits them.

## Our Mission

AEGIS is designed to:

*   Detect addictive patterns in teen digital behavior.
*   Nudge users to pause and reflect when engagement becomes harmful.
*   Provide safe journaling and trust-building exercises to strengthen mental resilience.
*   Give parents and educators tools to understand teen screen use, without invading privacy.

AEGIS is not about surveillance. It’s about guiding digital interactions responsibly, helping teens regain control over their attention and emotions.

## How It Works

*   **Behavior Logging:** Tracks anonymized, safe indicators of digital activity (scrolling, session length, interaction types).
*   **Pattern Analysis:** Uses ethical, explainable AI to identify potential “brainrot” or harmful engagement loops.
*   **Intervention:** Nudges, reflective prompts, and gamified trust levels encourage teens to pause, reflect, and regain agency.
*   **Dashboard:** Teens and parents can view safe, anonymized insights about patterns — no raw personal data is stored.

## Why AEGIS Over Existing Solutions

*   **Focus on Teen Safety:** Unlike current AI chatbots or platforms, which can inadvertently exploit vulnerabilities, AEGIS is built first for protection.
*   **Ethical Transparency:** Open-source design, clear methodology, and selfless intent — no data exploitation.
*   **Human-Centered Interventions:** Instead of replacing human connection, it strengthens self-awareness, reflection, and empathy.

## Future Vision

AEGIS aims to:

*   Expand interventions using AI that respects human development stages.
*   Collaborate with educators, mental health experts, and researchers.
*   Advocate for ethical standards in AI platforms used by minors.
*   Eventually integrate with mainstream digital platforms to protect teens before harm occurs.

## How to Contribute

AEGIS is open for learning and collaboration:

*   Explore the code, understand the interventions, and propose improvements.
*   Do not use AEGIS for harmful purposes — it is strictly designed to protect.
*   Report ideas, bugs, or ethical concerns via issues.
